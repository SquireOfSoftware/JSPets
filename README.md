To avoid copyright issues, I will attempt to duplicate a digivice…but with some slight modifications such as using a chicken as your pet that you battle random things like pig bosses, cats and stuff of the sort.

Think of it like a digivice but with a chicken as your digimon.

This whole thing would be a lot easier if I could get my own digivice to work…unfortunately I think the battery leaked into the internals and it has stopped working. So I need to go with the power of the internet and rely on what other people have put up. From my observations, it looks like the japanese D-power is a lot harder than the european one.

Screen dimensions
- One of the major things that I need to figure out, is how big exactly are the screens.
- Someone on reddit has made a watchface built onto a digivice.

- I also have included numerous other screens that I have collected over the research period, it looks to be like 128 by 128 on some screens (just looking at it by eye (no measurements)). 
The rectangular ones look like 43 by 19 (pendulum picture)? My eyes are horrible and I am pretty sure I missed some pixels out. Maybe round out to 48 by 20 pixels?
- The digivice that I have owned is called D-power, it has a card scanner on the side
- From this ebay image, I am estimating 20 by 20 pixels? http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Mzg4WDUwMA==/z/zs4AAOxyUylTVjLr/$_3.JPG?set_id=2
- See digim sprite image in the sprites folder to see my recreation of the d-power digivice. There is some question though whether the top if the D, G and M are actually two pixels high or one pixel high, I have assumed two pixels high but then it doesn’t look like it matches the screenshot. If it is one pixel high it does change the height of the digivice and makes it 20 by 18…so I will assume its a nice square to make things nicer and more “symmetrical”.

Screens

- This site looked promising…but they appear to have dead links, if they had the original sprites, it would have been so awesome. I checked the web archive and it seems they didn’t save the links. I think it has something to do with the PHP loading dynamic references rather than static references.
